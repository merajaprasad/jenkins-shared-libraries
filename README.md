# Jenkins Shared Library

- Jenkins shared library is a collection of reusable Groovy scripts that can be used by multiple Jenkins jobs.
- These libraries allow you to encapsulate common logic, making it easier to maintain and share across multiple pipelines and projects.
- we can enhance the modularity, reusability, and maintainability of your Jenkins Pipeline scripts using shared library.
- we can define 'functions' as groovy files, and all files should be inside 'vars' directory
